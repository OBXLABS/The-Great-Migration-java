\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Buzz Aldrin Didn't Know Any Better\
\
Sanyo, Sony, JVC, LG and Wigs, Buzz Aldrin would be proud.\
Wigs? Wigs. Black, blue, blonde, purple, pink,\
some on top of the sets like hats, \
some laying at the bottom of the window\
like metastasizing octopi drowning upward.\
\
32 inches just doesn't cut it any more.\
Long for a wig, long for hair, but as a screen it's a postcard, \
a porthole, a camera obscured by its own frame.\
Shall I try on the purple wig? I'm feeling bald today,\
my head is so exposed I feel naked down to my toes.\
There. It fits. I'm charmed. I'm charming. My skin\
is turning purple, octopus camouflage juju seeping\
down, down, down to my naked toes. \
\
What's that? I have to buy it? \
Can you turn off the camouflage? \
Does it come with a free TV? \
\
Does Buzz know you're here?\

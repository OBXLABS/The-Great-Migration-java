loosen up the soul belt mix up a tuna melt
belt out a show tune and finish that heart-to-heart with the moon
fig into the purple playdough licking your fingers as you go
tender forth some broken clams and head out fast on the lam
i'm not sure if this is happenstance
but let's not leave everything to chance
too much river, and not enough sea.
too much river, and too much of me
too much of me too much of me too much of me
if we can't do that, let's do this tap it up, tamp it down
twist at the end and bring the thunder down
tap tap tap tap it tamp it turn it around.
